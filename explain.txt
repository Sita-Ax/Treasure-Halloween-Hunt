Do the global variable that needs, and create the img global so it´s readable.

Make the function that initiates the whole game application the init and that calls the game UI.

Inside initGameUI is the setup, first the initChests make the boxes that contains the chest.
It´s needs an id so it can be inside the if state in chestClicked to choose chests. 
The refresh button will calls from this and also the eventlistner so if the wrong chest is clicked and
Try Again! is clicked it will give the new random chests.

When the right chest is clicked it´s gives 5points every time inside the scoreboard inside a h3 tag.
